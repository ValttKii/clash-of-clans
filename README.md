# clash-of-clans project

This is a full-stack web application project focused on providing data and insights related to Clash of Clans. The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js, fetching relevant data from the official Clash of Clans API using Axios. The project aims to display useful information such as clan members, player stats, and other Clash of Clans-related data.

## Project Structure
### The project consists of two main parts:

Server: The backend part of the project, which handles the communication with the Clash of Clans API and serves data via simple RESTful endpoints. Due to the need for an API token and rate-limiting restrictions, all requests to the Clash of Clans API are routed through a backend server.

Client: The frontend part of the project (in progress), which will display the data fetched from the backend in a user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Axios

Frontend: (Coming soon)


## API Endpoints
Refer to the [server/README.md](server/README.md) for detailed information on the available API endpoints.
